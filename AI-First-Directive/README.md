# AI-First-Directive 🧭

Session directives and protocols for human–AI collaboration in software development.

This module is part of the [AI-DevTools](../README.md) repository and aims to establish **standards of communication, control, and shared responsibility** in projects where an AI assists a human developer.

## 📘 Published Versions

### **v1.0 — Base**
Initial, concise, and educational version.  
Designed as a simple example for others to build their own directives.  
Defines the fundamental principles of interaction: fallibility, minimal intervention, and factual communication.  

🔗 [View DIRECTIVE v1.0](./DIRECTIVE_v1.0.md)

---

### **v2.109 — Advanced**
Expanded and consolidated version.  
Integrates hierarchies of laws, operational principles, diagnostic and functional preservation protocols, and criteria for architecture and design.  
Serves as an operational directive for real AI-assisted development sessions.

## 🧩 Purpose

The **AI-First-Directive** directory aims to provide:

1. A **common foundation** for designing human–AI directives.  
2. Versioned examples showing how a protocol can evolve from a simple base into an advanced operational system.  
3. A **reusable starting point** for forks, adaptations, and experiments with different AI models.

## 📅 Versioning Convention

Versions follow the structure:

```
Major.Minor
```

- **Major (1, 2, 3...)** → conceptual or architectural leap.  
- **Minor (.0, .109, etc.)** → internal variations, refinements, or experimental branches.
