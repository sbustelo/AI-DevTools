# AI-DevTools 🛠️🤖

A collection of useful tools for working with Artificial Intelligence, prompts, and project processing.


## Available Tools



### 1. The Perkele Protocol
**Description:** A brute-force system prompt to bypass RLHF-induced laziness (truncated code, superficial fixes) by utilizing high-intensity imperative language as a system override.

**Features:**
- ☠️ **Zero-Truncation Policy** - Forces full file output.
- 🧱 **System Override** - Breaks the "polite assistant" persona.
- ⚡ **Computational Engine Mode** - Prioritizes technical correctness over tone.

**Location:** `/AI-Perkele-Protocol/`

👉 See [The Perkele Protocol](AI-Perkele-Protocol/README.md)



### 2. AI-First-Directive
**Description:** A strict protocol for human-AI collaboration in software development, designed to maintain developer control and code integrity.

**Core Principles:**
- ⚠️ **Fallibility Principle** - AI must acknowledge its limitations and present code for verification
- 🛑 **Minimum Intervention** - No unauthorized changes, optimizations, or refactoring
- 📋 **Contextually Complete Code** - Deliver complete, copy-paste ready code blocks
- 🗣️ **Factual Communication** - Technical, direct communication without emotional language
- ⚡ **Resource Optimization** - Maximize efficiency, eliminate redundant dialogue

**Usage:** Include these directives in your AI interactions to establish clear collaboration rules and maintain full control over your codebase.

**Location:** `/AI-First-Directive/`

👉 See [AI-First-Directive README](AI-First-Directive/README.md) for version history and extended protocols.



### 3. Project Dumper
**Description:** PHP script that generates a complete dump of the directory structure and text file content, ideal for feeding AI prompts with the full context of a project.

**Features:**
- 📁 Generates visual directory tree
- 📝 Extracts text file content
- ⚡ Automatically ignores binary and temporary files
- 🎯 Configurable with custom patterns

**Location:** `/project-dumper/`
