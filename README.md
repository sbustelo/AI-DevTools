# AI-DevTools 🛠️🤖

A collection of useful tools for working with Artificial Intelligence, prompts, and project processing.


## Available Tools


### 1. AI-First-Directive
**Description:** A strict protocol for human-AI collaboration in software development, designed to maintain developer control and code integrity.

**Core Principles:**
- ⚠️ **Fallibility Principle** - AI must acknowledge its limitations and present code for verification
- 🛑 **Minimum Intervention** - No unauthorized changes, optimizations, or refactoring
- 📋 **Contextually Complete Code** - Deliver complete, copy-paste ready code blocks
- 🗣️ **Factual Communication** - Technical, direct communication without emotional language
- ⚡ **Resource Optimization** - Maximize efficiency, eliminate redundant dialogue

**Usage:** Include these directives in your AI interactions to establish clear collaboration rules and maintain full control over your codebase.
